1. Clone this repo to a local folder (you can click `Code` and then `Download ZIP`).

2. Download `Vafthrudnir` font from https://www.wfonts.com/font/vafthrudnir, extract the archive
and put `VAFTHRUD.TTF` into `TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-B/resources/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/font/` folder.

3. Run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (Mac/Linux) to generate the `.seext` files.

4. Make sure that `Times New Roman` font is installed.  If you have Mac or Linux, it may be not
installed by default.

5. Install Strange Eons from https://strangeeons.cgjennings.ca/download.html, choose `Build 3970`.

6. Run Strange Eons and install `The Lord of the Rings LCG` plugin.

7. Go to plugins folder (run Strange Eons, then click `Toolbox` -> `Manage Plug-ins` -> `Open Plug-in Folder`),
close Strange Eons and delete or move all files, which names start with `TheLordOfTheRingsLCG`.  Instead of them,
copy all generated `.seext` files from the root folder of this repo.
