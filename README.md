**Setup**

1. Clone this repo to a local folder.

2. Run `setup.bat` (Windows only) to generate the `.seext` files.  If needed, a Mac version will be added too.

3. Install Strange Eons from https://strangeeons.cgjennings.ca/download.html, choose `Build 3970`.

4. Run Strange Eons and install `The Lord of the Rings LCG` plugin.

5. Go to plugins folder (run Strange Eons, then click `Toolbox` -> `Manage Plug-ins` -> `Open Plug-in Folder`),
close Strange Eons and delete or move all files, which names start with `TheLordOfTheRingsLCG`.  Instead of them,
copy all generated `.seext` files from the root folder of this repo.
