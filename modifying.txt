Now you can modify anything. It's important to note that templates are mostly stored in JP2 format. 
Use Strange Eons to convert from PNG to JP2, I've found some programs won't convert them properly for Strange Eons usage. You can also change the setting for the templates to PNG.

After modifications, right click the plugin folder and it will pack it apropiately. left click twice to install it and reboot strange eons.
