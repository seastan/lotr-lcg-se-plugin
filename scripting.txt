To check editable values:
In Strange Eons, create a new component, open window menu and setting explorer.
In the new window, choose "None" at Parent settings to list (at the left bottom).
That shows all the settings that define user definable (though user interface) values for the component.
Aditional (expert level) values relevant to component creation can be checked selecting Inmmediate partent only.

updating custom portraits and icons through scripting
for main Portrait and PortraitBack
set $Portrait-external-path to value (example: "project:image.jpg")
this makes a default portrait install (fill portrait region with the image)
optionally, custom placement and scale can be defined
set $Portrait-external-panx to value (example: "20")
set $Portrait-external-pany to value (example: "-20")
set $Portrait-external-scale to value, where 1 = 100% (example: "0.8")
Once these new image and values are loaded they are deleted from the resulting eons file

updating EncounterSet, Collection and Sphere icons through scripting
set Collection-external-path to value (example: "project:image.jpg")
set the value to "Custom" (example: $Collection = "Custom")
note that placement and scale options don't work with these icons
